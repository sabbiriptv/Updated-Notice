# ⚠️ Updated-Notice

Dear fellow developers and GitHub community,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide an update regarding my previous notice about **shutting down my GitHub profile**.

After giving it much thought and considering the feedback I received, I have decided to **keep my GitHub profile live** for the time being. I understand the value it holds for the community, and I want to continue supporting those who find my work helpful.

However, I would like to clarify that I will be making some changes in the future. After my exams, I plan to **create a private group** for IPTV enthusiasts where I can share my modified IPTV M3U files. This private group will allow me to maintain a more controlled and secure environment for the content I provide.

Until then, you can still access and benefit from the IPTV M3U files on my GitHub profile. I apologize for any confusion my previous notice may have caused.

I want to express my gratitude to those who have shown **support and understanding** during this time. Your encouragement means a lot to me, and it motivates me to continue pursuing my passion for IPTV.

Thank you for your attention, and I appreciate your ongoing support.

Sincerely, <br>
Sabbir Hasan
